# Basalt
Decentralized application for connecting colleges and businesses

# About
This application is my final year software project for IT Carlow under the supervision of leturer Patrick Tobin

It aims to provide a place for colleges and businesses to connect and decerase the likelihood of a person 
getting a job with false credentials.

Colleges upload documents containing details of a student/graduates' academic details. This document is stored on IPFS and the link to where it is stored on their is returned and stored on the Ethereum network. 

Businesses can retrieve and view this document in order to verify a students' credentials.
